# BIOCB-6840-Metagenomic-Analysis
The final project report and analysis for BIOCB 6840 - Computational Genetics and Genomics, at Cornell University in Fall 2024.

We are interested in classifying which microbial species in mice were transmitted from donor(s) to recipient, when the recipient is treated with antibiotics. Given that donor and recipient are from different facilities, the hypothesis is that minor sequence differences will distinguish bacterial strains, even within the same bacterial species.
